# 🤖 Named Entity Recognition 🤖

## 🌐 Overview

This repository is devoted to the exploration and implementation of various **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**. Named Entity Recognition is a key task in the field of NLP, aimed at identifying and categorizing key elements in text into predefined categories such as names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

## 🔗 Dependencies

- #### Python 3
- #### Jupyter Notebook
- #### scikit-learn
- #### sklearn_crfsuite
- #### numpy
- #### gensim

## 🔧 Features

The repository begins with the **Conditional Random Fields (CRF)**, **FastText** and **Random Forest** models for NER, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of various machine learning methods in NLP.

## 🚀 Coming Soon

Work is ongoing to include more sophisticated NER methods. Future updates will introduce these machine learning methods:

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**. A type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependencies in sequence prediction problems.

- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**. A method for pre-training language representations showing significant promise across a range of NLP tasks, including NER.
